    "### GPU Aggregation Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute workloads can benefit from using separate GPU partitions. The flexibility of GPU partitioning allows a single GPU to be shared and used by small, medium, and large-sized workloads. GPU partitions can be a valid option for executing Deep Learning workloads. An example is Deep Learning training and inferencing workflows, which utilize smaller datasets but are highly dependent on the size of the data/model, and users may need to decrease batch sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why GPU Aggregation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Llama-3-70B and Falcon 180B, can be too large to fit into the memory of a single GPU (vRAM). Or in some cases, GPUs that would be large-enough might be difficult to obtain. If you find yourself in such a situation, it is natural to wonder whether an aggregation of multiple, smaller GPUs can be used instead of one single large GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, the answer is essentially Yes. To address these challenges, we can use more advanced configurations to distribute the LLM workload across several GPUs. One option is leveraging tensor parallelism, where the LLM is split across several GPUs, with each GPU processing a portion of the model's tensors. This approach ensures efficient utilization of available resources (GPUs) across one or several workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some Serving Runtimes, such as vLLM, support tensor parallelism, allowing for both single-worker and multi-worker configurations (the difference whether your GPUs are all in the same machine, or are spread across machines).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Components of GPU Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "GPU Aggregation is a complex topic and there are many components to consider. Fundamentally there are four core concepts to consider: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Tensor Parallelism\n",
    "* Pipeline Parallelism\n",
    "* Data Parallelism\n",
    "* Expert Parallelism\n",
    "\n",
    "In tensor parallelism, each GPU processes a slice of a tensor and only aggregates the full tensor when necessary for specific operations. This approach allows larger models to run efficiently across multiple devices while maintaining performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipeline parallelism differs from tensor parallelism in that it splits the model vertically (across layers) rather than horizontally (across tensor dimensions). Each GPU or node in the pipeline processes a complete subset of the model's layers, making it particularly effective for extremely large models like DeepSeek R1 or Llama 3.1 405B that cannot fit on a single node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Parallelism (DP) replicates the model across multiple GPUs. Data batches are evenly distributed between GPUs and the data-parallel GPUs process them independently. While the computation workload is efficiently distributed across GPUs, inter-GPU communication is required in order to keep the model replicas consistent between training steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expert parallelism is a specialized distributed computing technique designed specifically for Mixture of Experts (MoE) models. Unlike traditional parallelism strategies that distribute computation across all model parameters, expert parallelism leverages the sparse activation pattern of MoE architectures where only a subset of experts are activated for each input token.\n",
