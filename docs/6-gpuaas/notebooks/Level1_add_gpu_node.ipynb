    "4. **Alternative vendors**: Use non-NVIDIA GPUs. OpenShift supports multiple accelerator types, but this lab uses NVIDIA hardware exclusively.\n",
    "\n",

    "## GPU Sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "GPU sharing is a technique that allows multiple workloads to share a GPU. This is useful for small workloads that don't require full GPU power simultaneously. This can be broken down into three main components: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Time-slicing\n",
    "- Multi-Instance GPUs (MIG)\n",
    "- CUDA Multi-Process Service (MPS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Different applications have different computational requirements when it comes to GPU's. Training giant AI models where the GPUs batch process hundreds of data samples in parallel, keeps the GPUs fully utilized during the training process. However, many other application types may only require a fraction of the GPU compute, thereby resulting in underutilization of the massive computational power.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/gpu-concurrency.png\"\n",
    "     alt=\"GPU concurrency options\"\n",
    "     style=\"width:50%;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "[Read this blog post](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/improving-gpu-utilization-in-kubernetes/) to get a good understanding of these different types of sharing in depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our OpenShift cluster was deployed on VM's we could consider using vGPU (e.g. OpenShift Virt, VMWare). Since we are in AWS we can consider using **time-slicing** or **MIG** depending on the type of accelerator cards we have available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some Pros and Cons of GPU Sharing Methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/gpu-accel-capability.png\"\n",
    "     alt=\"GPU accelerator capability\"\n",
    "     style=\"width:50%;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**MIG** gives the highest level of physical workload partitioning but is only avaialable on the (more expensize) Blackwell, Hopper, Ampere architecture. See [here for a full list](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/mig-user-guide/index.html) of cards supporting MIG.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time-Slicing** is available with all GPU cards, but does not have the same level of isolation. Think of it like cpu based process sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Multi-Process Service (MPS)** is an alternative, binary-compatible implementation of the CUDA Application Programming Interface (API). MPS enables multiple CUDA applications to run concurrently on the same GPU, improving overall GPU utilization and performance. MPS is not currently supported on OpenShift.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use **time-slicing** in this exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is particularly valuable for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **AI inference workloads** that don't fully utilize GPU resources\n",
    "* **Development and testing environments** requiring flexible GPU access\n",
    "* **Multi-tenant scenarios** where isolation requirements are less stringent\n",
    "* **Edge deployments** with limited GPU resources\n",
    "* **Cost optimization** by maximizing GPU utilization\n",
    "\n",
    "Timeslicing enables organizations to dramatically improve GPU utilization while reducing costs, making AI workloads more accessible and economical.\n",
    "\n",
    "vLLM (our inference serving engine in RHOAI, RHAIIS) provides some useful benefit when using timeslicing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Multiple Model Serving**: Different vLLM instances can serve different models on the same GPU\n",
    "* **Improved Throughput**: Better utilization through temporal multiplexing\n",
    "* **Cost Reduction**: Serve more models with fewer GPUs\n",
    "* **Flexibility**: Dynamic allocation of GPU resources based on demand\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to prove out the single-gpu-per-node, multi-node example in this lab. There are lots of more advanced scenarios to keep in mind that we are setting the ground work for here.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Deploy multiple vLLM instances serving different models\n",
    "* Implement cost optimization strategies using timeslicing\n",
    "* Configure mixed workloads (training and inference)\n",
    "* Set up auto-scaling based on GPU utilization metrics\n",
