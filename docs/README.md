🐈 Daisy Cat is famous !🐈 and was one of the main attractions in the PetBattle app that formed the technical exercises in the book - [DevOps Culture and Practice with OpenShift - Deliver continuous business value through people, process, and technology](https://www.redhat.com/en/engage/devops-culture-practice-openshift-ebooks). Daisy inspired us to use many of the open practices described in the book to help deliver this Roadshow and we hope that you are like Daisy, where [**curiosity killed the cat but satisfaction brought it back**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity_killed_the_cat).

Welcome the the RHOAI Roadshow. Each of the modules is self-contained so can be run on the provided environment separately.

You get to choose the adventure you wish to explore Red Hat OpenShift AI with.

?> **Note** All images have _lightbox_ attached to them so they can overlay on top of the web page so you can see them. Just click on them ! (and click to minimize again)

?> **Tip** Be sure to set your cluster domain in the top navigation bar and hit `Save` - this updates the documentation hyperlinks to point to your cluster.
